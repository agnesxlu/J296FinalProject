## Data Diary
### Data Source
In this project, I'm using **two sources of data**.
#### 1. The monthly eviction data of the city of Richmond
The data was obtained through public record request from the [Richmond Rent Program](http://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/3364/Richmond-Rent-Program). The data include months from July 2020 to February 2022 in the form of two pdf spreadsheet. I also conducted two interviews with [Nicolas Traylor](https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/directory.aspx?EID=1342), the Executive Director of the Richmond Rent Program, and [Cynthia Shaw](https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/directory.aspx?EID=1386), the program's Assistant Administrative Analyst, to explain how they collected the data and what each row and column of in the spreadsheet represent, in case of any confusion. 
#### 2. The California Rent Relief Program application data of the city of Richmond.
This part of data was collected from the [California Rent Relief Program Dashboard](https://housing.ca.gov/covid_rr/dashboard.html) on the website of Housing Is Key, a rent assistance program established by the State of California. The dashboard covers data including complete household applications, total household served, average assistance, demographcis of applicants, and total funds paid by the program.
